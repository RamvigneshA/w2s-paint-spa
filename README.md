## Why MUI over Ant Design?

3. **Component Richness**: MUI provides a comprehensive set of components that cover all our UI needs, from basic inputs to complex data displays.

4. **Documentation**: MUI has extensive, well-maintained documentation with clear examples, making development faster and more efficient.
